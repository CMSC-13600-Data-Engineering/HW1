# HW1: SQL and Relational Data Modeling
In this assignment, you will practice working with relational databases, or data management systems that represent data as linked tables (rows/columns) of data.  SQLite is an open-source, zero-configuration, self-contained, stand-alone, relational database engine designed to be embedded into an application. While it is not completely realistic for largee-scale data analysis scenarios much of the syntax will be the same as other systems.
